# Working with this Repo

In class you are working on your own repository. This is mine.

If you have pushed your repo to Github you are able to "Do your own thing" and stay in sync with me as you want.

You create commits and push them to your repo.

If you want, you can:

## Reset Periodically with my Code

So, if you fall off, want to start over, get called out, and just want to catch up, but want the repository to be "yours":

Go to my [Repository](https://github.com/hypertheory-angular/asm-sept-2022) and click "Use This Template". This will copy my repository to a repository that you own.

After it copies it, you can click the "Code" button and on the Github CLI tab, copy the command.

Open a terminal in your `dev` directory and run the command.

After it pulls down the code, go into that directory and run:

```shell
npm install
```

After that installs, type:

```shell
code .
```

You are then all caught up! You can continue to code and push your changes to your repository.

Repeat as necessary. ;)

## Just watch me Code

If you want to just watch me code, and be able to follow along by looking at a _readonly_ copy of the code, you can go to my [Repository](https://github.com/hypertheory-angular/asm-sept-2022) and click the "Code" button.

Click the "Code" button and on the Github CLI tab, copy the command.

Open a terminal in your `dev` directory and run the command.

Go into that new directory and run

```shell
npm install
```

And then when it finishes installing the dependencies, run:

```shell
code .

```

You can watch me, and after I push changes up, you can pull them down by clicking on the ellipses at the top of the Source Control tool in VS Code and it will pull down my changes.

### Super Secret Third Way

Work from your own repository. Pull my code down in another directory, and copy stuff into your repository as you want/need.
